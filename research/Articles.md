Potential Variables
- Lack of transportation: Patients who do not have access to transportation may find it difficult to get to their appointments on time (This is a situation I have witnessed 
in the clinic where I work. There are some patients who rely on Access-a-Ride. If the schedules do not align, this can cause patients to miss their appointments)
- Conflicting schedules: Patients may have other commitments that prevent them from attending their appointments.
- Difficulty remembering appointments: Patients may forget about their appointments or not have a system in place to remind them.
- Lack of awareness about the importance of the appointment: Patients may not understand the importance of their appointments and why it is necessary to attend them.
- Lack of trust in the healthcare system: Patients may not trust their healthcare providers or the healthcare system, which can lead to them not showing up for appointments.

Potential Variables
- Financial barriers: Patients may not be able to afford the cost of their appointments or may be unsure about their insurance coverage.
- Poor communication: Patients may not have received clear instructions about their appointments or may not have received timely reminders.
- Health concerns: Patients may be experiencing other health issues that prevent them from attending their appointments.
- Poor fit with the provider: Patients may not feel comfortable with the provider or may not feel that their needs are being adequately addressed.
- Personal issues: Patients may have personal or medical issues that prevent them from attending their appointment, such as illness, caring for a sick family member, or dealing with a personal crisis.

Potential Variables:
- Impact of elapsed time: Greater time elapsed between booking the appointment and the actual appointment is associated with a higher probability of missing the appointment. 
- Impact of patient age: Older patients are less likely to miss appointments due to the inherent risk of aging and failing health. Younger patients are associated with a higher probability of missing an appointment. However, after approximately age 55, the probability of missing
an appointment decreases significantly.
- Wait times: Some patients may arrive for their appointment, but will leave if the wait time is interfering with their other planned activities. 
- Access to technology: Older patients and patients with a lower income may not have access to a smartphone with internet connection 
- Environmental conditions, such as weather and air quality, can potentially affect whether patients attend their appointments: For example, if a patient 
lives in an area with poor air quality due to pollution or wildfire smoke, they may be more likely to miss an appointment if they are experiencing respiratory issues or other 
health problems related to the air quality. Similarly, inclement weather or hazardous driving conditions may make it more difficult for patients to travel to their appointments. In this situation, 
although offering telemdicine appointments might sounds like a good solution, there are many instances where a patient needs to be seen in person and cannot be treated properly over a video call. Furthermore, 
some health insurance plans do not cover telemedicine visits (I experienced this first hand and had to delay an appointment to a later date where I could be seen in person as my insurance would not cover a video call).
